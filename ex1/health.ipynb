    "# Intro\n",
    "In this exercise, we will be using data from Aka & Bhatia ([2022](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/718456])) to predict how people perceive different health states. We will be using two different approaches: feature extraction and fine-tuning. The former involves extracting features from a pre-trained language model and using them as input to a separate model. The latter involves fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on the task at hand."

    "1. To run a cell, press ```shift + enter```. The notebook will execute the code in the cell and move to the next cell. If the cell contains a markdown cell (text only), it will render the markdown and move to the next cell.\n",
    "2. Since cells can be executed in any order and variables can be over-written, you may at some point feel that you have lost track of the state of your notebook. If this is the case, you can always restart the kernel by clicking ```Runtime``` in the menu bar (if you're using Colab) and selecting ```Restart runtime```. This will clear all variables and outputs.\n",
    "3. The final variable in a cell will be printed on the screen. If you want to print multiple variables, use the ```print()``` function as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook environments support code cells and markdown cells. For the purposes of this workshop, markdown cells are used to provide high-level explanations of the code. More specific details are provided in the code cells themselves in the form of comments (lines beginning with ```#```)."

This is not surprising since the model is trained to predict the labels directly, whereas the extracted features are trained to predict the labels indirectly (i.e., by predicting a masked word in the sequence). However, feature extraction is much faster than fine-tuning and may be less prone to overfitting for small datasets.\n"
