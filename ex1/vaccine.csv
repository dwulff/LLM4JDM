Looking at the probability of certain negative side effects and seeing if the vaccine genuinely protects someone would be very important.,0.625
"Not really, I looked at all the numbers and made a quick assesment on the ratio of the benefits and risks.",0.75
I weighed the side effects with the benefits and determined if the side effects were worth it based on how much percentage wise the vaccine protected from covid.,0.75
Percentages were important. In all things (medicine especially) there are risk and rewards that have to be weighed out in order to make the best decision. So I knew the categories would be the samesimilar but the percentages would be the ever chnaging factor to consider.,0.375
I would look up the potential side effects and how I. thought my body would react if those should arise.nI searched for months and i still research,0.25
"It's hard to say. I just tried to combine benefits and side effects and to apply them to myself, but I think that my own vaccination and the vaccine I had affected my decision.",0.5
Emotional choice,0.125
"Severity of risks listed, such as tiredness compared to blood clots. Protection against being infected in the first place was my main concern as for benefits.",0.25
To define some symtoms,0.25
I have not done any type of searches concerning the vaccines,0.125
"Sorry, but do you mean 'were there...?' With some of the choices I looked at more specific information, but the choices were made randomly.",0.0
I've been fully vaccinated yet caught Covid this year. Beforehand I was very pro-vaccines; my spouse got booster shot yet had more severe symptoms that I did. Now I was neutral about the vaccines especially the news that Pfizer was hiding some data and Big pharma been making record profits from the vaccines. I think we should be casting doubt on the vaccines efficacy; it's good to get vaccinated but also respect other people's feelings about vaccine and whether they want to get jab or not it's completely up to them. The way that vaccine mandates have completely backfired and it's why I switched my attitude toward it.,0.625
"I went down the line, left column uncovered 2 choices, moved down, etc, then over to the right column and did same.",0.0
"I mostly based it on the country of origin(China and the US and Germany can't be trusted), the others were based on side effects and how unusual they are based on all the other vaccines I've had in the past 57 years.",0.375
Severity of side effects and likelihood.,0.25
"Weighed the pros, cons, and probability of the side effects. My search behavior was more or less the same for each vaccine in the choice task. I did accidentally click the wrong choice for Pfizer (I said I would refuse to get this vaccination) and should have agreed to have been vaccinated by all.",0.875
I really only cared about serious side effects that would cause issues for the rest of my life.  I wasn't concerned about temporary discomfort.,0.625
I guess because of all of the DEATH and severe adverse reactions to vaccines that are basically for the common cold which supposedly has no cure.  I will not take that experimental vaccine as I have read so many terrible things about it.,0.0
"I searched through all of the information that was presented to me in this survey. I revealed the information on the left side first, then went through the information on the right side of the screen. I wanted to see both the benefits and the side effects caused by each of the vaccines. I was also curious about how often these side effects can occur from taking the vaccine.",0.0
I was looking for the percentage of protection against infection. I chose the vaccines that I believe are more effective against Covid and will provide me with greater protection.,0.5
informed by others smarter than i was in medicine and vaccines that i trust to tell me both the positives and negatives,0.25
What was most effective and that only took one shot. i just did not the full outcomes and i would be scared i feel i got lucky so far and will not take another shot,0.125
"I was interested in the efficacy percentages of the vaccinations presented. I noticed that I weeded out the ones that had lower efficacy percentages. I also did not like the ones that had severe side effects, like facial paralysis and heart problems.",0.875
Vaccination not worth it for my risk level due to side effects and low risk of severe covid,0.0
"There were not really specific reasons, I just went with how I thought I would decide.",0.625
I analyzed the percentages given with the other factors and tried to make the best decision with my gut feelings.,0.0
I would try to see what the percent chance was of getting side effects or of getting sick. Then I would pick if I would get it or not.,0.375
equal risks to benefits are important to me. also availability of the vaccine and number of people that have received it.,0.625
Went in order left to right as they were presented,1.0
"Not really, I'm pretty open to vaccines so I would get all of them except the one that really wasn't all that effective",0.875
I would not want any COVID-19 vaccine at this point in time. I don't see it as a legitimate threat. I also would not pay to avoid taking it because that doesn't seem like a realistic scenario to me.,0.0
I am a medical professional still seeing covid every day and I have personally seen the benefits of the vaccine.,0.75
"No, I just reviewed the information that was presented",0.0
I just went top-to-bottom left-to-right.,0.25
"I would not take any of them. I looked at all the criteria, but I would not take any. Covid is a flu, no one should be afraid. I would not risk a runny nose to shoot up unknown junk for a flu. I have heart disease history in my family, not worth the risk.",0.0
I did my searching and research based on scientific facts and figures.,0.375
"Looked at all information, payed specific attention to rates of severe side effects and rates of protection (want to see high rates of protection, if rates of protection were low then more risk adverse when it comes to side effects)",0.75
I looked at the percent effectiveness and then weighed the side effects.,1.0
"I just wanted to see how it would protect against COVID 19. I felt that this task was unreliable....since COVID has changed. NOT ONE VACCINE Will protect AGAINST getting COVID. So what am I really getting vaccinated for? nIf I can still get COVID, what good is the vaccines?",0.625
I generally prioritized looking at the information regarding vaccine efficacy over possible side effects.,0.875
"No, I just know too many people that suffered complications from the vaccine. I don't want it.",0.0
No.  I wanted to see all the facts.,0.5
I tried to take a stance on how I felt about different kinds of vaccines and what their side effects where.,0.0
"I searched and got information from qualified sources:  medical community, congressional testimony, world-wide statistics, CDC data (published, but often inaccurately reported), scientists, and applied my own critical thinking skills.",0.0
No. I just read the information presented to me and used my rationality.,0.25
"no, looking for severe risks",0.75
I weighed the risks and the benefits. None of the risks were worth the potential benefits for me in this task.,0.0
I looked at every choice. In no particular order. Most important factors were effectiveness against severe and death.,0.5
"The most important to me is there should not be severe side affects that could risk life in the vaccine, the second is how good it prevents COVID.",0.625
"I had general impressions of each vaccine presented based on news and information I already read. I was not really interested in the benefits listed as I am not concerned in the least about getting a COVID-19 infection. I was exclusively concerned with the risks and the manufacturer of the vaccine; I would never trust a vaccine made in China, for example.",0.25
I answered based off of personal research and my own perception. My search behavior was assertive because this matter should be taken seriously since it is something that will affect your body and possibly life.,0.0
Not really,0.0
did not search I am 60 yrs old natural immunity or death,0.0
No specific reasons at all.,0.375
"I was looking for highest efficacy rates, really, and not too focused on side effects. I'd recently been vaccinated against shingles, penumonia, and had a T-dap vax. I had MMR as a kid (and a teen and a young adult, something about a bad batch of vax when I was young). I even have a smallpox vaccination scar. I remember a kid in elementary school who had trouble walking because she'd had polio. Most people under 50 today have no idea what a pandemic really looks like and also, rely too heavily on mass mediatv and have poor critical thinking skills, so I worry for future generations, especially because of the anti-vax movement.",0.375
"Overall, I looked at how likely the severe risks were to occur and then looked at the overall effectiveness of the vaccine. If there were some rather high risk effects of the vaccine, it needed to be extremely effective at preventing COVID in order for me to consider taking it.",0.75
"I was worried about severe side effects since I don't want that. Also, if it's from China I don't trust it.",0.5
I was wary of any side effect described as severe and I tried to focus on the ones where it was unlikely you get covid and unlikely you die or get severe covid.,0.625
I just wanted a reminder of the numbers that various entities claim for each vaccine.,0.0
I would say I focused more on the side effects than any other aspect of the vaccines.,0.125
"no, overall I feel very negative towards the covid vaccines, I would not get one right now",0.0
"I used prior knowledge of 4 of the different vaccines. I trust Pfizer and Moderna, but not the others.",0.375
"My search was characterized by the variety and severity of the bad reactions created by the vaccines. My health is already greatly affected by fatigue, muscle soreness, etc. There is absolutely NO desire on my part to exacerbate those conditions with something that would not only make my life appreciably worse, but would do so at the expense of my ability to work.",0.0
"Yes, as a general rule I am certainly pro-vaccine utilizing attenuated or dead viruses as has long been the case and certainly has a very good safety profile. I am not, however, willing to trust a recently developed mRNA vaccine with a questionable safety profile",0.5
"I looked at each category and to look at the data.  I accidently clicked that I would receive one of them, but I meant no to all of them.  I did get vaccinated but will never again in the future.",0.25
I looked out for side effects and its benefits.,0.5
I looked at each item and weighed the pros and cons,0.5
I focused more on the effectiveness rate than the side effects unless the rate of side effects were high and very severe.,0.625
The benefits (protection) is more important to me than side effects - but some side effects are bad enough that they swayed my opinion. I have an autoimmune disorder so side effects of attacking the system is a hard no for me.,0.375
"I mostly looked at the risks and side-effects, since the vaccines don't really seem to prevent people from getting COVID.",0.125
I looked at all the information provided and went with my gut in terms of what risk I was willing to take - or not.,0.375
"I chose after seeing the side effects and the highest possible outcome. If the side effects were severe, but the percentage rate for effectiveness was high, I chose not to take the shot. If the side effects were minimal and the percentage of the effectiveness was high, I chose the shot.",0.375
"I always checked the benefits of the vaccine, and then compared them to the risks. Then I made my decision to whether it was worth it or not. I didn't really care about the technology nor the country of origin.",0.625
"I attempted to see all the information that was available during the tasks. That said, since the tasks were comparing vaccines that were widely known, my previous knowledge and relationship to those vaccines did play into my answers.",0.5
No,0.5
"I looked at effectiveness more than I did side effects, and usually based my decisions off of the effectiveness.",0.25
I'd take any approved vaccine,0.875
I just wanted to know the side effects,0.5
I read UNCENSORED news and know the truth.  Why would the vax companies want to hide the truth for 75 years?  The FDA lost a court case and have been forced to release thousands of pages of information each month now.  Why not check out the TRUTH.  Many people are waking up to the cold hard facts.  There are MANY doctors risking their lives to get the TRUTH out.  Why have so many been killed?  The truth WILL Come out for ALL to see.,0.0
If they had severe side effects I just wouldn't want to do it.,0.625
I made my choices based on which of the information was most reliable for me. And my search behavior was decided on which of the vaccines I would take.,0.25
"I wanted to read all of it and I just started in the left column and went down then repeated for the right. Because I am most afraid of getting long covid (much more so than dying, especially because vaccines are so effective against death), the most important piece of information to me was the level of protection against getting any covid infection since that can happen from even an asymptomatic case. However I was not willing to pay for these on principle because all covid vaccination should be free as it is a major PUBLIC health risk and not an individual burden, no matter what any one says.",1.0
na,0.25
"I did a lot of research on mRNA.  My brother in law is an immunologist and he explained it to me but I still mistrust it. I don't want it. I think there are a lot of things we just don't know yet aboutlong term events. Also, as I feel COVID-19 was developed in a lab in Wuhan, China, I do not want any vaccine from China. NO NO NO.  I will stick (no pun intended) with the tried and true methods of vaccination, even if they are not quite as effective. My daughter had the Pfizer vaccine, my husband had Moderna AND the booster, my son and I had J & J, my daughter and her husband both had the Pfizer plus booster and guess what?  We ALL---every single one of us--got the virus and we were all sick with about the same symptoms for the same amount of time. People in their mid twenties and people in their early sixties.  I think it has been a huge windfall for the pharmceutical companies and we were all dupes and guinea pigs. You know who has NOT ever gotten COVID-19? My brother, who never had one single vaccine.  This whole thing makes me distrust health experts and makes me very skeptical of any new advice they have for us.",0.375
i searched how effective each vaccine was in protecting against covid and the side effects.,0.875
"I refuse to take any vaccine from China straightaway, I don't care about any other facts about the vaccine. Anyhow, all of these damaging vaccines are globalist racket. I eat organic vegetables from my own garden, this household eats clean and stays fit, why on earth would we take ANY risks for some protection against a little bug that made me sick for 6 hours? I was born at night, but not last night.",0.0
I tired to focus on the side effect numbers and gauged that against the benefits.,0.875
"I took a look at all of the benefits and risks and if the number of people experiencing side effects labeled as severe were high, that made me less likely to take that vaccine.  I want to avoid severe headaches and muscle pain as much as possible, even if it means accepting a risk of blood clot or some other catastrophic event.  The rates of those catastrophic events were usually incredibly low, most times less than a fraction of 1%, so I was willing to risk that assuming that I would not have a horrible reaction like that.",0.625
negative side effects takes precedence,0.625
"I was more interested in the benefits than the side effects. However, I admit that rare and scary side effects (such as facial paralysis) grabbed my attention, and I was less willing to entertain the risk of acquiring them, even a slight risk.",0.375
"I looked at a few of the boxes but since this whole vaccine nightmare started I have been getting a lot of information from a private newsletter that I get from a very trusted source , in my email. I also have been taking the advice of my acupuncturist who is the only medical practitioner that I now trust. I  know a lot about this and I would never under any circumstances get  any of these poisonous vaccines. I personally know one woman who got heart inflammation from it and almost died and I know of another man who DID die from it . Not including all the other thousands of people all over the world who have died or been crippled by them . If I was held down by a government agent and forcibly injected with it I think I would be so terrified that I might commit suicide.  I would  be in such a state of terror that I would just lay in bed and shake and scream . I  am NOT anti vaccine . I got all the childhood ones and I got the shingles vaccine several years ago. THIS is different . It's just as much of a bioweapon as the virus that was deliberately unleashed on the world as an act of war by the communist Chinese government . And it worked . Western civilization , and especially America has been destroyed by it and now the Chi Coms are taking over the world . It's a nightmare .",0.0
No and I have a wait and see attitude given the virus was madly overhyped and it is nowhere near as lethal as it was projected but it has done a good bit of damage to civilisation anyhow.,0.0

"I searched for side effects per million to do cost benefit analysis. However, in all reality I said NO to every company except India. My confidence in vaccine manufacturers and medical bureaucrats in general has fallen massively during Covid19 response. India got a possible yes because they didn't play politics with their citizens health when Ivermectin was proven effective against severe Covid19, and simply distributed it in care packages.",0.125
Just basically weighed the side effects and effectiveness. The more severe side effects and lesser effectiveness I said no to.,0.625
"Basically, I looked at the percentages in terms of how much they prevented Covid andor its seriousness. Also, the country of origin. If the rates of tiredness, etc. were particularly high I considered that along with percentages.",0.625

"I just looked to see if there was any info on the risk of the particular issue I have with the vaccines, which is tinnitus, which I already have a severe case of and which all of the vaccines I've studied thus far can make worse. If it was not addressed, I said no. And it was never addressed. I wear N95 masks and stay home.",0.0

"not really, just based on information about vaccines already present",0.5
I did not because I formed an opinion a year ago. The vaccine is not old enough.,0.0
I looked for protection against severe illness and death and measured that against permanent or dangerous health side effects. I also refused any vax from China as I don't think their formulation is high quality or trustworthy.,0.75
I was more interested in the search for the effectiveness of the vaccine.  If the effectiveness was not greater than 90% then I would not be interested in receiving the vaccine.,0.25
side effects and percentage of effectiveness,0.25
I would love the benefits of being vaccinated but the risks are too high for me to take. I feel like getting the vaccine would be like gambling with my life.,0.0
"I was mostly concerned with the frequency of negative side effects. I'm curious about some of the reported numbers, referring to the chances out of 1000000 that these negative effects occur, and wonder if they're a bit lower than what actually is the case in reality. I wasn't so concerned about prevention of infection with COVID, since that's almost impossible to truly avoid. Severe infection or death from COVID are things I'm statistically unlikely to experience, so those weren't major concerns either.",0.0
I am strongly opposed to chinese vaccines (due to testing  effecacy issues) and mRna vaccines (due to no long term side effect profiles and unknowable risks),0.125
low side effects,0.5
I focused on effectiveness rates and the number of people who had severe reactions when deciding. I was outweighing the pros and cons.,0.75
"My biggest concerns are heart-related side-effects and blood clots, so I would avoid any vaccines that could cause them. I already have severe cardiophobia and arrhythmia so I would hate to do anything that would potentially aggravate my symptoms. I was more open to Novavax because it sounds more traditional and the side-effects seem milder.",0.125
I didnt search for information on vaccines. I just read everything and gave my best response on the questions,0.25
Country of origin is the most important factor.  Familiarity of company names also affected my choice.,0.625
"I don't have any special requirements or conditions but do live with someone who has multiple autoimmune disorders and is at higher risk for covid complications so whatever she felt safest taking, I was also willing to considering the amount of research she's done and what is on the line for her.",0.875
I looked mainly at the percentages and how high or low they were. I also looked at things like where the vaccine came from.,0.25
i looked at the risks and effectiveness,0.5
I gathered all info about all areas,0.625
"Asking general attitude towards a vaccination is a misleading question, or at least you likely will get misleading answers. I actually have very little against CHOOSING to get vaccinated when I determine that the riskrewards are worth it. Unfortunately covid was 100% politicized and a major authoritarian power grab that has practically eliminated personal liberty in the US. We might pretend that these measures are being eased up (why should I be thankful that the government is kind enough to give me back my freedom??) but the population has proven that they can be controlled with fear and will submit to anything that their overlords say.nnBut anyway, wouldn't touch anything from China, I have no faith in any numbers they may claim. I am skeptical of mRNA not because I distrust it, but because the government, pharmaceuticals, and media actively suppressed and ostracized anyone who hinted at having an alternate opinion, and refused to even consider that there might be cheaper  existing TREATMENTS rather than this blind desire for a vaccine.",0.25

"I knew from the beginning that this whole thing is a huge psyop. When Ovenor Jay Inslee required face skams that is when I knew for sure this whole thing was a lie. I watched a video today about a pilot who had the shot (it is not a vaccine) and had a heart attack while flying a plane full of people. According to VAERS a lot of people are having very bad reactions. I used to get vaccines for my job because I worked in social services at schools, hospitals, and prisons. I will never get another vaccine again. Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab have an agenda.",0.0
I was primarily focused on the effectiveness of the vaccines,1.0
"I relied more heavily on the side that were intolerable for me, but I also required at least 90% efficacy in protecting against different aspects of Covid-19.",0.5
"Well unfortunately given all that's happened around vaccines I came into the study having seen a lot of information (whether correct or not) and formed opinions on the vaccines. I understand statistical events but even when they are really low I still have to ask myself do I want to roll those dice? I was originally offered J&J as a first vaccine. I declined it because it had whole DNA in it and I didn't like the viral vector because even though it's said to be safe if you had been exposed to it, the the shot would be useless because your immune system would attack the vector before the DNA could be delivered to the cell. This is why I don't like vector vaccines. I've come to be very hesitant and skeptical about the mRNA vaccines as well. I don't know it that is still sitting in my body replicating to allow some side effect to come up later. Not to mention it's obvious at this point that they don't have anywhere near 90+% efficacy against infection. Anyway, regardless of the rate of incidence, if the side effect is severe I think twice about getting it because it seems like I always have all the side effects. Generally I would feel safer with taking a more traditional vaccine that contains subunits or disabledkilled virus. And finally I feel that other mitigations are more important that vaccines currently available since they aren't doing a lot of good. In 2021 I was very much for these vaccines and I got the Pfizer vaccine as soon as it was available to me and I got the 2nd dose and even a booster, but now I'm not happy with the results of everyone still getting infected. So many people I know have been vaccinated and infected anyway and these vaccines do not protect anyone from long covid or whatever else this virus might do if it lingers around in the body like the epstein bar virus does. I hope you get what you need on this study but I think most people are going to come into it with bias from information outside the study unless they've been living in a remote cave or something",0.375

For example, if it said 25 people out of a million would get heart inflammation, I multiplied 25 x 300 (since there are about 300 million people in the US).  That would mean 7,500 people in the US might get heart inflammation if all were vaccinated. I don't want to be one of the 7,500 people. I don't feel comfortable trusting the efficacy data without knowing the actual numbers used for the calculation.",0.0
"I have doubts regarding the vaccine effectiveness.  At first they said it was virtually 100% effective against being hospitalized, but I know a lot of people that have contracted covid and had health effects.  It's just like the masking.

I am double vaccinated and boosted with the Moderna shot, but after the British Medical Journal published about Pfizer potentially committing fraud -- and knowing that pharmaceutical companies are profit-driven even at the expense of the health and safety of patients -- I am beginning to have hesitancy around the Covid vaccines because they didn't go through the normal testing process to ensure safety.

"Although all responses to vaccines in the choice task were negative or unwilling to receive, I would say that I didn't realize certain countries were developing vaccines as well, the Netherlands was a hypothetical I believe? I would be much more positive towards a European country developing a vaccine, or Chinese. In my search behavior, I always try and look for specialized working groups, because they always have the best information. UK's MHRA is very good, for example. When I watched the FDA's recent public hearing for VRBPAC, I was just horrified really. These vaccines aren't the same as previous vaccines, they're not being followed up if there was a problem. We don't have the provider support to understand that there could be a problem. And if they do, one wouldn't normally be able to find any neurological or rheumatological or hematological help here in the US. It's just very taxing to the system, as is COVID, to endeavor without being open to these possibilities. I look in the news too, because I may want to find some of the vaccines that aren't being supported the same as the main ones. I may want to look up more on say, non-natural nucleosides. I don't have a good knowledge about the mechanisms where I could fully explain it, but I do know that there is concern of backtracking into the body's DNA or mutagenesis. Not just people talking, people who give presentations. I do trust those scientists, because there is no other reason to bring it up unless it was a possible problem.

"No, I did not search for information about the vaccines. I was administered the only vaccine available at the moment - Pfizer.",0.375
"The effectiveness of the vaccine is number one, then looking at the side effects.",0.625
The country of origin is one of the most important factors for a vaccine,0.625
the blood clotsface paralysis were some of the most concerning. I also went by percentages how protective they were against getting severely sick with coviddeath,0.625
I was mainly weighing the severity and probability of the side effects against the probability of the vaccine doing its job. Two of the vaccines had low enough effectiveness that they did not seem worth the risk.,0.75
"I don't mind getting vaccines at all, even with severe side effects as long as they're rare. I mainly looked at the side effects.",1.0
"I wanted to see the risks (and their likelihood) for each of the vaccines. For those vaccines with what I considered more dire risks (for example having the immune system attack parts of the body), that formed the bulk of my decision--I would not select that vaccine.nnFor the ones that didn't have such dire risks, I then concentrated more on the benefits, where I would rate vaccines with higher levels of preventing death or severe COVID-19 infections as being more desirable.",0.75
"I always looked at all the information, but I was particularly interested in the protection against severe COVID-19 and death. Typically I'm not too worried about the side effects since the really bad ones are very unlikely to happen, and the other side effects are less dangerous than getting severe COVID-19.",0.75
"I worry about death and significant side effects, so that is number one.  I factor in a little that they may be underestimating as the studies were rushed and probably flawed.  On the effectiveness side I don't want to get injected with things unless it is likely to do the job.  So pretty much above 90 effectiveness or no.  I am not worried about myself - I am healthy, not immunocompromised, etc.  But I am willing to do my part to help society and others.  Ultimately there is some risk we can die of anything.",0.875

"I mostly looked at the percentage of effectiveness of protection especially giving weight to severe covid and death.  Secondly, I looked at the side effects and how often they occurred.  But before I even started searching, I paid attention to the name of vaccine and country of origin.  I was more likely to trust vaccines I had already read about in the news.",0.625
I went one row at a time a looked at all the information. I would characterize it as thorough.,1.0
I mainly looked at severe side effects and how it related to fertility or long terms problems.,0.25
"I mostly chose the vaccines that had higher than 80% protection against infection from COVID-19, and those that did not have severe side effects.",0.625

"effectiveness, country of origin, parts of actual virus, more extreme health hazards.",0.5
I looked for the least severe and scary reactions and the best outcomes for severe covid19 possiblities.  Getting covid19 had less of a factor because I see covid19 as something that we all my catch eventually and that doesn't scare me because I am vaccinated and double boosted.,0.75
"I looked at the number of people who suffered side-effects vs how effective the vaccine was in protecting people from infection, severe infection, and especially, death. Myself and a close family member have compromised immune systems and were being extremely cautious, but contracted COVID before the vaccines were invented. We both were hospitalized. I take COVID-19 very seriously and feel grateful for the vaccines.",0.625
"For me it's all about preventing severe Covid andor death. The side effects were not large enough to really be an issue for me, because they were likely to not happen.",1.0
I looked at all the information but took a closer look at the numbers for preventing fatal side effects of covid. The rest of the numbers I looked at but were not as an important factor.,1.0
I CHOOSE WHICH VACCINATION WAS THE BEST AND THE LEAST SIDE EFFECTS.,0.5
I looked for serious side effects and weighed that against it's effectiveness. If there were major side effects then I looked at the prevalence of those side effects. 16 out of a million is pretty good odds.,0.5

I looked for vaccines that had effective rates in the 90 percent range both for not getting COVID, for not getting severe disease, or for not dying because I don't want to get COVID period. I got the Moderna and was very happy to see the percentages listed. I really didn't care about the technology as long as the symptoms were manageable, and the effective rates were in the 90 percent range.",0.5

I looked at effectiveness above everything else.,0.25
"I began with country of origin. Due to the authoritatian nature of China's government and censorship of information there, I do not trust Chinese vaccines to be safe.  I don't believe they would tell you if they were unsafe or ineffective.  I rated the rest of the vaccines on the basis of rate of effectiveness and low extreme side effects (which eliminated Johnson and Johnson)",0.5
"Not really, I closely observed the percentage of protection as well as the severity of the risks of the vaccines in choosing which to take or reject.",0.625
There weren't specific reasons. I just looked at the risks and benefits and weighed them to myself.,0.75
I found different answers and have heard the CDC say they were not sure about long term effects. they have said I don't know to quite a few questions. I feel that we are the trials for the vaccine since it has never been used on humans. This is still only been approved for emergency use and have never gone through the proper testing.,0.0
I looked for high percentage against covid with the least amount of side affects.,0.625
"I had a stroke from a blood clot before. So, I do not want that again. I am anemic. Anything attacking my blood would be bad. I don't want my face to be paralyzed or my nerves to be damaged.",0.625
"The 2 main factors were the likelihood of protection against Covid (especially severedeath), and the likelihood of side effects I considered very negative (as opposed to more mild ones like tiredness). I was also more likely to trust brands I heard of like Moderna and Pfizer.",0.875
"I was primarily interested in how well the vaccines protected against COVID-19, especially severe COVID-19 and death. Bad side effects took a secondary role, as I feel that most bad side effects are preferable to death.",0.75
I looked especially at the country of origin and gauged the severity of the side-effects,0.5
which one was the safest,0.375
"I was mostly interested in how effective it was at preventing COVID. For the risksside effects, I did not mind typical side effects (headaches, muscle pain, fever, fatigue) but if it was something much more serious like blood clots, I did not say yes.",0.75
"I would mostly against the life-changing side effects, ones that will stay with you for a long time.",0.375
The only information that I was mainly concerned with were percentages of severe side effects of vaccines. I found that the less severe side effects were acceptable.,1.0
Country of origin,0.375
"I scanned all the information, but I was mostly looking for high protection against death or severe cases, and low likelihood of the most dangerous side effects like blood clots.",0.875
"Part of it was definitely name recognition, as I have literally been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine. I think that a lot of the vaccines that I've received in my lifetime probably have similar risk possibilities as the ones listed in this study, so I tried to not be too critical of any of them, but any vaccines with side effects that seemed to affect larger portions of people had to be well effective against COVID-19 for me to be in support of it.",0.5
I based my searches on my own preexisting health conditions. My search behavior was moderately interested.,0.375
weighed risks vs benefit.  heavily weighted negative side effects despite effectiveness of vaccine,0.5
I saw how effective it was and then how severe the side effects were and whether it was worth that risk for that much protection,1.0
"I looked for efficacy, side effects, and severity of side effects. I was pretty involved reading the data and making an informed decision.",0.625
Country of origin was important and how much I could suffer with certain side affects,0.5
I gravitated toward vaccines that had the highest efficacy,0.75
"I went mostly by how effective the vaccine was going to be, if it was under 80% that doesn't sound like a very reliable choice. I did also consider the side effects, but there are side effects to every vaccine and the numbers were pretty low for all the vaccine choices.",0.625
I didn't do any research. I based my answers off information I read previously.,0.5
I just wanted to know how well the worked and how extreme the side effects are.,0.75
I looked for percentage of effectiveness first and then looked at the chances of a negative side effect happening and weighed the pros versus the cons. I was definitely more negative thinking about the shot to begin with so it took a lot to click yes i would get that shot,0.25
I looked at the severity of the risks and how commonly they occurred before I decided,0.875
I weighed the benefits and risks of each vaccine,0.75
"I would rather have almost any vaccine than no vaccine at all.  I also live below the poverty line, so I cannot pay much for vaccines.",1.0
I based it on numbers and how high or low they were.,0.5
I just hovered my mouse over every detail about each vaccine.,1.0
"I knew that I would get any vaccine to help with COVID, and I thought of it in a vacuum, as if each one presented were the only one available to me vs. all the other ones being available. It turned it into a yes or no choice, and the side effects would have had to be pretty severe AND pretty likely for me to not protect myself against COVID.",1.0
If there are thousands of people with severe side effects I would not want it.,0.0
There was not. I legitimately just looked at all the information I was presented with and made decisions based off of that.,0.625
Thank you,0.0
I looked at all the risks and all the benefits.  And tried to weigh them and make a decision.,0.75
No I just went with what I saw on the news,0.625
I got my vaccine based on the two that were vailable in my area at first. Moderna was the one that was being given ner me so I went with it and with future boosters I have stuck with the same branding.,0.75
All the information provided me felt like they were reasonable when the alternative is severe covid and death. Even a 70% chance at protection is better than being unvaccinated with 0% protection. God knows I can't depend on my fellow man to help keep me and my family safe so any protection is better than no protection when anyone could be the next typhoid mary.,1.0
"Looked at the laboratory, the country of    origin, the overall effectiveness, and finally the side effect frequency",0.25
my decisions were mostly influenced by the percentages for the scarier side effects,0.875
I wanted to avoid anything above a 2% chance; and anything approaching a 1% for a severe symptom or immunocompromising vaccine,0.75
I wanted the best info possible.,0.75
I just tried to be objective as I was searching.,0.875
I didn't search online.,0.625

Any side effect that was of the heart or a blood clot.,0.5
I prioritized life altering negative effects and country of origin.,0.375
I used official websites such as the CDC site. I also listen to discussions between researchers and scientists. I would say it was an objective search but more research.,0.625
The vaccination against this specific virus has been useless and the benefits are nil unless you are in a risky group.,0.0
I want to see side effects and success rate first of all.,0.25
I was concerned about my age and heart and lung condition.,0.0
looked at how severe the chances of getting the really bad side effects vs. the effectiveness of the vaccinee against severe infection andor death. and made my decision accordingly,0.5
"I didn't really search for any information, I simply decided that no matter the risk the reward of having some protection outweighed that risk.",1.0
I looked at the risks and chance of them,1.0
"I didn't pay much attention to the type of vaccine, but concentrated on the benefits and potential side effects. It was difficult, however, to get a good sense of risk from the side effect statistics since a number out of a million is a bit abstract.",1.0
"It was interesting to find information about technology of each vaccine, its effectiveness and side effects.",0.375
I mainly just checked their actual stats.,0.75
The mandates,0.0
I didn't necessarily search out information in a specific order. I just read in the order from top to bottom and left to right that it was presented. But the most important to me were the numbers to show effectiveness and how common a certain side effect was (especially if the side effect was more serious).,0.875
"I looked at the prevalence of negative side effects of types that I felt really uncomfortable about, like heart issues.  Most other types of side effects, like fever and headache, were of no concern.nI also looked at overall effectiveness at preventing Covid, preventing severe Covid, and preventing death.",0.75
"I just wanted to know how much discomfort I would potentially receive for how strong the vaccine protected from the disease. Overall, if the disease could be most likely confirmed that I would not get it then I worried a lot less about the side effects which all seemed low odds of happening to me in the first place.",0.75
"My primary motivation in deciding whether or not to take the vaccine was almost entirely based on its efficacy. Anything with 90% efficacy or above was an automatic yes from me, regardless of side effects. Anything less than that does not seem worth it to me, especially with the prevalence of breakthrough infections. I am also young and very healthy, and I know that side effects are just a sliver of what can come with full-blown COVID. I also experienced side effects from all three doses of the vaccine I received, and if anything, I was happy to know that the vaccine was doing its job. Furthermore, when I got COVID myself, I was already double vaccinated, and the symptoms were still pretty bad for me u2014 I had the sorest throat I had ever had in my life and I lost my voice almost entirely for several days. That really indicated the severity of this virus, and I think that some side effects are a small price to pay to avoid that.",0.5
I wasn't willing to get vaccines that could cause death or lifelong problems (like facial paralysis),0.625
"As being a young person with fairly healthy immune system, i care more about the effectiveness of preventing getting covid than other factors",0.875
I wanted to look for high effectiveness and low severe side effects.,0.375
I was interested in country  of origin. I wouldn't take any vaccine that originated in china. I also don't believe that a vaccine for covid is needed.,0.0
"No specific reason. I had 2 vaccines and have experienced heart beat skip since then, so I am not in favor of vaccine",0.25
no,0.625
I was looking at the side effects first.,0.25
I just wanted to see the effectiveness and the side effects percentages,0.375
I would never do a comparison the way information was presented in this experiment.  I would make a table with risksbenefits of each vaccine and look at them together.,0.75
I mainly looked at effectiveness and whether there was a fairly high chance of severe side effects. I would have liked to know how long the side effects last.,0.875
didn't search,0.375
"Information seeking, I simply attempted to learn the information that was offered.",0.25
I was mainly looking at the protection % and where it was made.,0.625
I read the information given in each task carefully and selected options I considered true to me.,0.375
I didn't care for vaccines with side effects that could be fatal. I also leaned towards the higher percentages of effectiveness.,0.375
Just what had good ratings and low effects,0.75
I looked at all the information.,0.75
No specific reason. I looked at all the information presented to make my decision.,0.0
I chose by their effectiveness and severe adverse reactions.,0.625
I did it based on the percentages and if the pros outweighed the cons. I was looking for high protection effectiveness paired with the lowest chance of dnager.,0.625
"I tried to get a picture of how much I would be protected from COVID of various levels of severity, and I looked to see how extreme a possible side effect could be, such as facial paralysis.",0.875
I looked for the most severe drawbacks and felt less comfortable with those being emphasized and I also looked at the percentages of vaccine effectiveness to make my choices. I'm not sure how I would characterize my search behavior.,0.625
I looked at all of the information available before making a decision about anything,1.0
"I did not search at all. I had a bad case of covid and received the monoclonal antibodies. I am already on blood thinners so the risk of that side effect is small. I learned all about the vaccines both from my doctor, and my son who is an infectious disease MD",0.375
mostly relied on the percentages and the severity of the side effects.,0.875
"In general, I didn't pay much attention to the risks and mostly focused on how effective each vaccine was at preventing COVID-19 infection and death. Many of the risks were very uncommon side effects. The only one I remember standing out was the 1-in-10 risk for severe muscle pain, which is NOT the worst side effect possible.",0.625
"I had an allergic reaction to the first does of moderna covid vaccine.  Lips swelled up..eye lids closes, hives all over body and accompyning a rash with severe itching, scars by the vaccine site of moderna called a covid rash...and was very sickly for 3 weeks...Not more vaccines for me.",0.0
No,1.0
"I took whatever vaccine I could as soon as I could. Almost all worked effectively and even though the Chinese vaccine was a lot worse if it was my only option I still would have chosen it. I am worried about some potential effects, but I'm always willing to roll the dice",1.0
I took the information presented to be true as instructed.  I looked at the odds and found all of them better than no vaccination.,1.0
"The utmost important consideration for me was the overall efficacy of preventing an infection, mitigating the effects of COVID-19, and how successful the vaccine was in preventing death. Other than that, I looked at the ratio of more severe side effects (like facial paralysis) and decided if the percentage was low enough for me to consider using the specific vaccine. The form of vaccine, like mRNA or viral vector, did not matter as much to me.",0.5
"I compared the severity of the risk, the percentage of the risk, and the percentage of effectiveness and decided if it was effective enough to risk it.",0.375
i mostly just glanced at each one to make sure there wasn't a buried attention check in there. I consider moderna the best vaccine available but they're all fine and I wouldn't reject any of them,1.0
"In the choice task, I simply looked at the positive and negative effects because I should know both. I don't think there was any specific reason of strategy I used.",0.875
I looked at all info before making my choice. Both negative effects and positive outcomes are important to me,0.375
I looked through each item sequentially. I did not have any particular concernfocus in mind and I wanted to make sure that I had the full picture of all the information available.,0.75
I searched for the most effective with the least amount of side effects.,0.625
"I looked at the effectiveness of each, and focused on that",1.0
Looked at the effectiveness % of each vaccine available to Americans and choose to be vaccinated with Pfizer's vaccine.,0.5
There was no specific search.  I just feel it was rushed and the companies were not being honest about the possible side effects.,0.0
"My specific reasons are due to health concerns for the future, that may impact me worse. My family are aware about this, and my behavior is scarce.",0.375
"I think all the vaccines had a decently high number for protecting against death from Covid, and very low numbers for any serious risks. Therefore I think taking the vaccine outweighs the risks in all of the cases. Especially because I live with a loved one that is compromised, so the vaccine would also help protect them as well.",1.0
"The higher percent of effectiveness, with the fewest side effects, or life endangering side effects.  I had no side effects with Phisers' vaccine, so I knew that would be my first choice.",0.375
"I went by the percentage it protects from covid-19, severe covid-19 and death-covid-19.  Next, I went by the number of how many people experience side effects and what the side effects are.  From there I decided if the data was really good to warrant taking the specific vaccine.",0.25
No,0.5
"I wanted to know most importantly the three factors, effectiveness of reducing death, severe illness, and contracting the illness.  I knew that the severe side effects were quite rare, so I checked these but was less concerned. I was not particularly concerned about minor side effects. I concentrated on effectiveness. I was most interested in preventing severe illness and death, and most interested in mRNA vaccines, which I had researched when the vaccines first came out. So, I checked these thoroughly.",0.75
"The specific reasons I searched were the side effects. Being tired and headaches are one thing, but blood clots and facial paralysis is entirely different.",0.125
I looked at all of the information.,1.0
"I was mostly concerned with getting Covid, or getting severe Covid. The side effects are so low, I wasn't concerned with that.",0.875
No specific reason aside from just reading the data points.,0.625
"I have a bias against medical technology that originates in China so China was knocked out consistently.  Next, how effective was the vaccine in  preventing death, then severe infection and lastly infection at all.  Lastly I measured severe side effects vs uncomfortable side effects.  Severe being judged upon the numbers as more important.",0.75
"I had to look at all the information presented me.nIn order to weighu2014you knowu2014the pros against the cons.nAs you saw, there were some vaccines I specifically denounced.nI denounced some of these: and I feel sorry for those individuals who were stuck with such inferior options.nnWhat did you mean by severe muscle pain  by the way?nIs that the feeling one normally gets, eventually, by way of one's immune system kicking up its inflammatory response to the foreign invaders?n(The terr'ists  as George W. would sayu00bf)nOr is this a severity above and beyond the normal flu-like experience?",0.5
I looked at every single box for every single vaccine to have the most information possible.,0.625
"I made sure to look at all the pro's and con's even if I decided against on each. Anything with 95% efficacy or less was an immediate dismissal. Unfortunately the sever side-effects of the more effective vaccines, while unlikely, where very off-putting. As far as I'm aware, past vaccines weren't really allowed to be made publicly available if a good number of people were having moderate reactions ... much less severe to life threatening ones.nn((I don't know if I'll get to mention the part where I was asked to pay to AVOID being vaccinated, but I put $0 on that not because I was on the fence but I felt that was some weirdly dystopian measure that I'd not put money into out of principle.))",0.0
The protection from the initial virus was the most important thing for me.,0.375
I got COVID and had no symptoms. It would only protect me and I don't feel like I need it. I didn't really do much research,0.75
Most research centered around possible side effects and their severity.,0.5
"When evaluating each vaccine, I mainly considered how high the percentage was for protection from severe COVID infection and death as well as the degree of the risk of severe complications that could be long-term. I most strongly favor vaccines that have a very high percentage of protection against severe infection and death from COVID and also have a relatively low risk of severe complications that I assume could be long-term.",0.625
I feel like there needs to be more data available in order for me to take any Covid 19 vaccines.,0.0
"I feel that I searched with equal amounts of fear of negative effects, and enthusiasm for good results. I tried not to let country of origin be a primary factor, but there are some countries I'd avoid, either because they are hostile to us, or I don't know enough about their technology to trust it. For example, Russia was not on the list, but it had been, that would have been an automatic no based on both of those reasons. I avoided vaccines if it seemed if I felt there was an unreasonable risk of a dangerous side effect, such as blood clots or heart inflammation, but I have no problem with the normal immune response side effects I'm used to - tiredness, muscle pain, fever, etc. I was excited about some of the positive stats. They triggered thoughts of the normal things I could do if vaccinated with that choice.",0.5
I really just paid attention to the science and news about it.,0.625
I did not search for information about the vaccines in the choice task.,0.0
"I looked at all of the information for each vaccine in the task, to get a clear idea of the risks and benefits of each vaccine.  I paid close attention to the risks, especially when they were very high (like 100,000 in 1,000,000), because I definitely wanted to avoid those vaccines.",0.125
I just tried to get a general feel of the effectiveness versus side effects and seriousness of those side effects.,0.5
I looked at all the information available.,0.375
I have been reading peer reviewed clinical trial journals like the Lancet for the past two years and am not a vaccine advocate.,0.0
"I was more concerned with the possible side effects than the possible benefits. I first wanted to know what possible side effects there were, then how likely each side effect was before I even went over the benefits columns. Then if the benefits weren't all that great either, I didn't want anything to do with the vaccine. To me the possible side effects themselves were also more important than the probability of those side effects happening. Just the fact that it happens enough that it is considered a side effect at all is enough for me to be too afraid to get the vaccine.",0.25
"This is what I have learned about how sneakie and underhanded the media has been. Instead of letting the facts speak for themselves and letting people make their own choices devoid of media bias, the media made it very hard to trust any info out there by removing anything and everything they do not agree with and putting in their pie in the sky ideas and people saw this and it really ruined many peoples trust in the media and government agencies and good luck getting that back.",0.25
"I simply hovered my mouse over the risks and side effects first, which often resulted in me ruling out vaccines if they had high incidence of severe side effects. However, I waited to hover over the protections and effectiveness info also before making my final decision of whether to get the vaccine or not. I was searching for vaccines that had high levels of effectiveness in preventing infection, serious symptomatic infection, and death, especially, from COVID-19.",0.25
I asked around which vaccination was better and so I went with Moderna as it seem to have fewer after-effects.,0.25
"Well, in the beginning I knew I would never agree to get a vaccine, but I did look at the info.  I would never get one from China.  I looked at side effects and no matter how small the percentage I didn't want to be one of them who suffered.  This vaccine is a political stunt.  I've known fully vaccinated people in perfect health getting covid and put on a vent and dying.  I'll take my chances.  I use supplements to pump up my immune system.  The government should focus on diabetes and things like that!!!!!",0.0

I'm not to sure I would take some I didn't want to,0.625
"Other than the potential risks and benefits presented to me, I found myself trying to remember the information regarding covid-19 vaccines I heard or read in the news.

"I paid close attention to the country of origin, I would be more afraid to get a vaccine from China. I honestly do not feel comfortable getting the Covid vaccine yet as there is just not enough information regarding long-term and future side effects or complications. So it was difficult for me to feel positive about any of the vaccine choices.",0.0
i already knew the information except for a few of the vaccines.,0.375
I would characterize my search behavior as highly skeptical of any data presented by big pharma or their lackys as throughout this whole ordeal they have been deceptive and wrong.,0.0
I was mostly concerned with severe side effects,0.0
"I did not have a specific reason in regards to the way that I searched for information in the choice task. To be honest, I wanted to gather all information that was provided for each vaccine. Even with the amount of data that was presented, I was not willing to take any vaccination.",0.0
"I don't want to get a vaccine mainly because cells used from aborted fetuses were used in the research and testing stages of most vaccine production. So, I tried to see if any info was provided on vaccines that didn't use aborted fetal cells in any stage but this wasn't provided. So, I just hit the no option for each vaccine. I wasn't sure if the viral vaccines or subunit vaccines were fetal cell free. I wish that info had been provided. There's got to be a vaccine out there that doesn't use aborted fetal cells in any stage. I also tried looking at the side effects closely. Even if there's a small risk, I'd rather be safe than sorry.",0.0
"Trust was a big factor for me. Not all developers are trustworthy in my opinion. I believe at least one (i.e., Pfizer) has ulterior motives for some of their actions and I don't feel a need to enrich the company at my own medical risk. In addition to that, I determined the seriousness of the side effects in comparison to the likelihood that it would actually affect me personally. If it's something I could live with, such as muscle pain, tiredness, etc., then I am more likely to take the risk and get the vaccine.",0.375
I just wanted to make sure the benefits outweighed the side effects for me. I'm a mom of three kids so I have to worry about how much they would affect me.,0.375

I reviewed information from left to right so that I did not miss any details.,0.25
"I looked at all of the information before responding but if the vaccine was from China I knew I would say no regardless.  ALSO, I thought a key piece of information was missing.

I do not trust mRNA and did not want to get injected if it provided little immunity,0.25
I looked mostly at the Effective rates of protection,0.125
"I looked at the info, but no info provided could have outweighed the research I've done on my own, using both the CDC website own information, WHO's information etc. Anyone with half a brain would know that, based on the info those sites alone provided, COVID was never a danger to anyone without at least 4 pre-existing co-morbidities or that were elderly (stats from the CDC.) And let's be for real, old people catch and die from common colds that turn into pneumonia all the time. Anything takes them out because they have weakened immune systems.",0.0

Would not want a vaccine with potential for severe side effects.,0.125

I am not getting vaccinated - those statistics for negative symptoms are 'watered' down and are much worse and the effectiveness is also a lot lower.  It's not worth chancing.,0.125
"I looked at side effects first, if they were too great I wouldn't want to get the vaccine no matter how awesome it was.  Then I looked at the benefits, if they were high (for me 90's felt good) then I went back and double checked the side effects.  But also, if there was a low chance of success, why bother and risk the side effects.",0.25

I just looked at what the risks were and none of them were worth it to me.,0.0
i am not at risk so i didn't want to deal with negative long term effects,0.375
"I was mostly focused on the protection from getting infected, as well as any side effects and the likelihood of them. I've only had COVID once, but that time was hell, and if I felt free to get vaccinated I would do it to avoid getting COVID again. I wasn't bothered by seemingly minimal side effects like headaches, but only stayed away from more severe effects if a lot of people were getting them.",0.375
I just looked at all aspects overall,0.5
I searched to find out what the outcome of death behind taking the vaccine.    I finally decided the benefits outweighed the bad.,0.25

I looked at things that effected the heart,0.25
"Most of the negative symptoms seemed pretty easy to deal with and were kind of expected (things like drowsiness, muscle pain, etc). The only thing that would make me less likely to select a vaccine would be if it seemed ineffective enough that by waiting longer before being vaccinated a more effect vaccine would likely be produced. Although the safety of the vaccine itself didn't seem important, the way it interacted with a potential future vaccine was unclear, leading me to avoid it",0.875

Side effects were my first thing I looked at no matter what. Everything else was minor compared to that and the frequency of the side effects.,0.0

To see which ones were the safest. I searched moderately.,0.375
no. i don't know how i would characterize it. cautious i guess.,0.375
it was easy cause im against vaccination,0.0
"Yes, there were a few important things I looked at when doing the choice task. The first thing was based on the Country that produced the vaccine, I would be much more willing to take an United States made vaccine than one from China for example. Next I looked at the % chance of the negative outcomes, if they were very small I would be more likely too take it. One last thing I looked at was the success rate, if it was low (50% success rate for example) I would definitely not want to take that vaccine.",0.375
I'm against all of the covid-19 vaccines and see no reason to get them. I've had covid once for sure (possibly twice) and it was no worse than a cold. I don't need a vaccine for a cold.,0.0
"I will generally not get a covid vaccine no matter what, but any side effects that damage your heart or nervous system is automatically ruled out.  Also I would not want something out of india or china.",0.0
"I just thought about how much I wouldn't want to deal with the symptoms and whether or not I felt the vaccine was worth after having COVID. My search behavior was more about how well I felt the vaccine would protect me given my age and health. I thought about the symptoms and my previous COVID infection, too.",0.375
"I checked mostly for severe health consequences related to the heart muscle or severe headaches. I also checked the efficiency of each vaccine in preventing Covid. Since each vaccine had side effects, it would be pointless to endure the side effects and still not be fully protected.",0.625
Nothing really specific,0.0
Effectiveness and what country it was made in.,0.375
"I FIRST looked at the percentages for the side effects, then determined if they were worth risking the percentages for the protection.",0.0
My main priority was the effectiveness of the vaccine,0.5
I based my choice of vaccine based on how severe the side effects are and the effectiveness against severe covid symptoms,0.5
"I looked at the information provided. The vaccine, the company the country, what type, and effectiveness. I followed the instructions.nn I tested regularly throughout covid. I had one vaccine given to me at Boston Medical, (I was there for an x-ray and they just gave me the vaccine) I trust and do what Doctors tell me, they were giving the vaccine to everyone in the ER that night. Just before the world shut down for Covid. I guess it must have been March 2020. There was no vaccine yet according to the News, but they were giving vaccines to everyone during that time. My Doctor promised me that I would not get the corona virus. My job shut down and I went traveling. I tested every few months, always negative. Finely it got me, Jan 28, 2022. I think I got it from a travel employee who checked my travel ticket. He had watery eyes, and I thought he looks like he has a fever. Then the next day, I tested positive, I was told for the omnicrom? I do not know the spelling. I was in isolation for ten days they said. Mostly  I felt tired, and mild regular flu symptoms. They tested me after 7 days. I was negative and free to go. I imagine that all of the vaccines are good but they are also bad. Mostly I am slightly afraid of the side effects. I did not get sick the entire time, then when I got sick it was mild. I still wear my mask on public bus. But most people where I am do not use their mask. I feel great. And I pray that the virus may be under control. That we as a world can move away from a pandemic that shut down our jobs and our world. Yet, I did enjoy aspects of covid. Like isolation, and staying home resting, I used the time to travel and I had a good time. I feel sorry for families that lost loved one's. I am lucky I did not lose anyone. I just want for the covid drama to be over. I do not want to contaminate my biological unit with any stuff. I mean tell me whatever about any vaccine, but I have always taken vaccines for everything, whenever instructed to. But covid vaccine creeps me out. I do not why.",0.0

"A vaccination for anything, Covid or whatever disease, should not have any adverse affectseffects to a person, period. If it's the correct vaccination, there would be no side effects. It would kill off the diseasegermbacteria before it caused a problem with anything, it would only attack what it needs to attack without causing symptoms or death. Scientist have people believing that side effects are the norm for vaccinations, well it's not. The statistical numbers are a bunch of bullshit too... I had friends to die in my community from taking the vaccines and boosters and had some contracted heart problems and weaknesses and were healthy people. The one's of us that have not been vaccinated have not died or had any worse side effects than having a cold or flu. I know for a fact that Covid is real, I seen people catch it and I have seen the aftermath. nAnother reason that I will not take it, I had to take a flu shot because I was working at a nursing home, back 15 or so years ago and I contracted bronchitis and I had it really bad for two weeks and thought I was going to die. I had never been sick in my life with flu or anything and after I got over that, I have never had another flu shot and I will not get another vaccine for it. I rarely ever get sick and it's because I know how to use common sense by wearing a mask and keeping things clean and avoiding people.",0.0

Either way, you eventually come to the same conclusion; there is no such thing as a safe or effective vaccine.

The problem is because of the politicalizing of the vaccine while the numbers presented were interesting I do not trust any of the governmental or commercial sources of the data presented.

Based on my study of the published scientific data and available reported statistics the effectiveness numbers presented in this study are over inflated while the data presented on the risks is under reported.,0.0
I made my decision on how bad the side effects were and how many people it effected. It was okay in my opinion if there were bad side effects as long as the risk for me getting them were low. If the chances of getting the Covid-19 was very low than I thought one was a good option to get.,0.5

"I looked at the effectiveness of each of the three benefits of the vaccine. I was leary if the rate of infection percentage fell below 78%. When considering side effects,  I have chronic nerve pain and muscle pain already. I did not want to risk having it increase. Blood clots and facial paralysis were definitely a deal-breaker. I have had Bell's Palsy before. It didn't matter how effective they were, I didn't want to risk those specific side effects. Somebody has to be in the numbers who get those side effects, I don't want it to be me. The mRNA vaccines seemed to have the least potential side effects for me. I didn't worry too much about the heart inflammation since I don't have heart issues, and the incidence of adverse side effects, on the whole were very low.",0.375
"Mostly just by the side effects, because lots of people will be taking the vaccines so many people will be affected. Also, whether or not the bad symptoms outweighed the good ones.",0.375

"I looked at all of the information that was presented, but there are certain side effects that make me more hesitant to get certain vaccines, such as blood clots or paralysis. Even though the risk is still small, I am not particularly concerned about COVID, so I don't feel it's worth even a small risk. I would be very willing to get one of the other vaccines that do not seem to have any side effects that I would considered severe or overly concerning.",0.375

"The specific reasons I searched for information was mainly based upon comparing the number of people involved with the associated risks and comparing that to the percentage of effectiveness for the benefits. If there were side effects that had several thousands of people experiencing negative side effects, that tended to sway me from selecting yes for those vaccines. The level of seriousness of possible side effects also tended to sway my decisions, because some vaccines had high numbers people experiencing side effects that were in my opinion less serious but other vaccines had low numbers of people experiencing side effects that I considered very serious. I would characterize my search behavior as comparing risks for the side effects. Regardless of high effectiveness rates for benefits, vaccines with either serious side effects that were possible or vaccines with less serious side effects that were common tended to result in me being unwilling to get them.",0.375
"I just looked at the risks of every vaccine and the percentage of people that suffered those risks, then I looked at the effectiveness of each vaccine against COVID death",0.375
The biggest factor is the country that created the vaccine. I would be more likely to chose a vaccine created in American versus one made in either China or India.,0.375

"I looked at all the data presented in this study and looked at the numbers in great detail.  Most of the information now on vaccines is misinformation.   To give you an idea why, Pfizer work hard with the courts to hide all data on the trial studies and wanted to keep this information from the public for 75 years!  The courts struck down Pfizer's request and was ordered to release information on the trial studies, 500 pages at a time.  In this information, they listed 1,195 known side affects from their vaccine.  I know much more than the average person on vaccines and I have read many studies from the US and internationally on Covid-19.  Here is what I found out with my investigation.   The Covid-19 vaccine is not a vaccine from Pfizer but an experimental gene therapy.  Animals who where first given the covid-19 vaccine in the beginning trials all died.  This vaccine is not approved and has not been  tested on humans before vaccination began.  We also do not know the long term effects of this gene therapy because it takes 8-10 years to complete long term studies.  The Covid-19 is a real virus and it can kill some older people as well as people who have a compromised Immune systems.  Covid-19 has been around since the 1970's, but not in this form.  Covid-19 has been weaponized and was created in a lab in China.  What makes this virus unique is that it has a very high rate of gain of function with spiked proteins, meaning it can spread very easily and very fast.  The person who discovered Aids has published several papers on Covid-19.  He is a top scientist and virologists.  After looking at the virus under a microscope, he found it to be a virus with five different strains in it.  It also has as an HIV delivery system.  There can be no vaccine made to counter this.  This Covid-19 virus is in the Influenza, cold, flu, and pneumonia family.  This virus mutates quickly.  It is impossible to find a vaccine that will work with Covid-19 because it changes so fast.  And like the common cold, it is impossible to find a working vaccine for this strain, because there are thousands of strains.",0.0

"I think I was mostly benefits-oriented in looking at the information. If I'm seeing 90%+ protection I'm more likely to tolerate some risk vs. if the benefits are in the 70's% or lower. The exception to that was, I think, the Indian vaccine because it was an inactivated virus vaccine which I personally feel more comfortable with since the technology has been around for a lot longer. One of the risks you didn't list was potential future complications from the nature of mRNA vaccines, if any. That entered into my mind a little. But overall, if I saw really good protection numbers I weighed those heavily against possible negative outcomes.",0.625
I just compared them and made the decisions that I made. I characterize them as normal I thinking.,0.375
I based my responses on the percentages given and the severity of the side effectsrisks of getting the vaccines.,0.375
"I found myself re-checking the probabilities for the risks as I re-evaluated the negative event. For example, with the severe muscle pain, I noticed that I had an evolving perception of what this would actualize into. Some memories of experienced pain were more noticeable  at different points and this impacted my willingness to go through re-experiencing the pain levels from this event. The specific events  I equated to severe pain included falling ~50 feet out of a tree, passing gallstones, gout flareup and getting hit by a care. At some point, I also began to worry about the possibility that severe muscle pain is even worse than these experienced events.",0.5
I'm not going to get vaccinated for any reason.,0.0
"I looked first at whether it would protect me. Some I immediately ruled out and didn't need more information. Of those that would protect me well (90% or higher), I analyzed the severe side effects to see how likely it was I'd get them. If not very likely, then I ignored them. If likely, I looked at how bad they would feel compared to COVID.",0.5
avoid companies with a shady past and with known side effects,0.25

But i can choose whether i am willing to risk my future and my future children for politics.  The shots from the begining were said to make the symptoms more mild but it does not in fact prevent the spread of Covid.  I am not an antivaxxer.  my children, husband and I are all up to date on vaccines.  We do not get flu shots either.",0.0

My search behavior was to start with the effectiveness. I then went on to look at the severity of what the side effect was and how common. From there I made my decision.

I thought about how large the benefits were against the possible risks involved.,0.5
"No, I did look for general information and spoke with friends and family about their choices.",0.625
I listened to my instincts. And I responded according to my feelings. this is my request,0.375
"My primary concern was the overall effectiveness of the vaccine. My secondary concern was the likelihood of severe symptoms. Notably, only one vaccine reported an extremely high rate of any real side effects - Moderna suggested that 1 in 10 recipients got severe muscle pain, which wasn't encouraging. However, it was quite effective. I tried to be methodical but I lean heavily toward vaccinations.",1.0
How bad the side effects were. Specifically any that involved the heart. I have health anxiety and thats why I haven't gotten it. I also have a fear of needles. The heart side effect seems to be the worst side effect you can get. After the facial paralysis.,0.25
I wanted to see which ones have the biggest risks and avoid them.,0.5
i wont get vaccinated so my choices were easy.  i scanned the info but the bad outweighs the good,0.0
"Thorough, I wanted as much information as possible.",0.75
No. I would characterize it as thorough.,0.25
I looked at the percentages of how well the vaccine protected you and what the possibilities of side effects.  How the virus was manufactured or where it was made did not make a difference to me.,0.5
I looked at all information available to me.,0.375
I wanted to see what the risk were the most and how many people could be effected then see what the benefits are since to me the risk were the most important factor when making my choices and when looking at the information.,0.75
I have a few health complications that put me in direct jeopardy of heart and blood clotting issues with any of the vaccines. My doctor has currently advised me that the risk they pose to someone with my history isn't worth it.  Until something better comes along or more testing has been done I rely heavily on masking and good overall health practices and quarantining.  if it changes then I am open to trying something safer for myself.  Also if I had to pay to not receive a voluntary vaccine or for a government to force certain health care options on me then it's time for a new government.  That is insanely unethical. coronavirus is just that it's a virus it's not polio.  The flu is also a virus and the flu shot is voluntary.  Society doesn't have any right to force people to make health decisions that is an individual choice.  If a person is dumb enough to make the wrong choice well that's their right to.,0.0
Nope!,0.625
No. Looking for information,0.25
no,0.375
I judged based off side effects and effectiveness the most.,0.125
no,0.5
"No specific reasons, mostly just looked at the vaccine effectiveness and if a side effect seemed severe or not.",0.5
I looked for risks and how well it protected against Covid. Why get the vaccine is the risks outweighs being protected. Why get the vaccine if there is a larger change of it not protecting you.,0.75
"I did some research on each of the available vaccines, but my primary influence was reading experiences of friends and family and comparing the side effects they experiences with each of the vaccines.",0.625
I carefully evaluated what was presented to me and used my own judgment.,0.375
My main concern were the side effects so that's what I looked at first to determine whether I would get it or not.,0.25
"I got the vaccine because my wife asked me to, and there were certain things that we could not do if we didn't receive it. I got the flu shot once, and within a month I got the flu really bad. My view of these vaccines is not favorable. I caught covid with 3 months of receiving my 2nd shot. I do not like being told that I must get vacciniated.",0.25
I weighed the potential benefit with potential harm,0.25
none,0.5
I looked for the severe side affects,0.875
I admittedly don't have time or honestly the education to read and truly understand peer reviewed studies. I tried to find information from unbiased and trusted sources who reviewed the studies and passed along the information.,0.5
"No, I just don't think these vaccines were researched enough because they were rushed.",0.375
na,0.5
I searched for side effects first. I know that the side effects can be pretty bad sometimes. That is one reason that I chose to not get vaccinated.,0.0
I focused on the side effects more than anything.,0.25
"Ive researched all these vaccines. None of them work, and they all have severe side effects up to and including death",0.0
there was no specific reasons for how i researched the vaccines. i went by general knowledge,0.375
I looked at the risks first then at the benefits of that vaccine; then determined if the risks outweigh the good,0.625
I looked for severe side effects and the efficacy of preventing the disease.  Also I do not want any vaccine from China.,0.625
I weighed risk vs benefit including how likely the reactions would be vs how severe they would be weighed against the level of protections from Covid.,0.5
"I really focused on the overall effectiveness of the vaccine, and if the side-effects were anything less than a moderate discomfort, such as blood clots or paralysis, that vaccine was immediately a no.",0.375
"I am not looking to get the vaccine, we do not know much about the long term effects.",0.375
"I stay current and abreast of information posted on the World Health Organization, the CDC and other national health and world-wide organizations.  Furthermore, I stay on top of the Vaccine Incident Report.  Additionally, there are far too many folk getting this ailment after being fully vaccinated which leads one to question the viability of the information and vaccine. Originally touted as 100% effective...now being told a booster shot will be needed on a regular bases..only increases ones chances to encounter adverse side affects.  No, thank you. I do not plan to pay to have to take nor to avoid taking it...as this matter will soon blow over and we will move on to another world-wide planned disaster from the Apocrypha.",0.0
based on risk. i am extremely risk averse,0.125
I observe how people reacted the getting the vaccine. I made my own choice by not taking it and I am waiting for more data to come out before making such a big decision.,0.0
"No, there was not any specific reasons how I searched for info. I was just checking all the statistics, I didn't believe them necessarily, just checked to see what they were.",0.0
More interested in side-effects than efficacy.,0.0
Anything from China or mRNA was an automatic no. If the vaccine had even a remote chance of doing substantial harm it was an automatic no. Effectiveness did not factor into my decision.,0.25
Looked at the number of people that suffered from the outcomes of the vaccines and what the outcomes were. Also looked at how effective the vaccine was at protecting against getting the virus.,0.375
just not a fan of the vaccine,0.5
I really didn't have any specific reasons for how I searched,0.5

I didnt research vaccines,0.0
"no need, you have a 99.7% chance of surviving, why would you need to? if covid was as indeed we were told, so contagious, why didn't all the homeless, drug addicts and prostitutes all pass away. they didn't wear masks, social distance or wash themselves hmmmmmmmm, just stop, the democrats have their little sheep who listened to the likes of the worst italian doctor fauci ever and the who and the cdc who know nothing, people still wear masks outside by themselves and driving by themselves in cars, I just shake my head and wonder how anyone could be so stupid",0.0
I basically just weighed how bad the side effects would be and rated accordingly,0.0
I looked for the risk of severe side affects and the frequency of them,0.5
No. Just looked at country of origin and effects.,0.25

No,0.0
"My main issue is long term or permanent side affects. If the only complications consisted of headaches or muscle soreness, I could handle that. I cannot handle heart problems or nervous system issues.",0.25
I like my research behavior to produce facts rather than speculation to go on.,0.125
No,0.0
I only searched it because I was going to get it to just get it out of the way.,0.25
"Usually country or type of method of delivery indicated was enough. I was less trusting of vaccines from China & India initially, though I would rather take those than an mRNA vaccine. I looked more at adverse outcome stats because I thought they would vary more than the positives.",0.0
Looking for unbiased real facts from objective sources.,0.25
I really didn't go all to much into researching it (one reason why I'm not vaccinated) but when I was looking for information I was taking it either straight from the doctors or trustworthy people I know.,0.25
I looked for all information that the vaccines had because it's better to get a full scope of what you're looking at before making a decision. Though I put more weight towards the effectiveness of the protection.,0.5

I weighed the benefits vs risks while knowing that the data was very unlikely to be fully accurate.,0.5
Went by more type of side effect rather than frequency.,0.0
"I generally hovered over each dark section & then moved to the right to see the relevant information. Then I went down the list accordingly. Sometimes, I came back & hovered over a piece of information a time or two more, just to make sure I felt comfortable with my decision & didn't doubt myself. During the study I tried to be open to being vaccinated, even though I am not currently & have no plans to be.",0.0
Checked out all the boxes,0.0
I compared benefits to risk. I did not give as much weight in my decision to the country of origin or manufacturer of the vaccnine.,0.875
"I searched first for life altering side effects; such as facial paralysis, clots, and inflammation.",0.625

i just get information from my family,0.0
"At first, to figure out the survey and how I could best answer to help your research, I searched the boxes. Then I realized, there is no reason to do so. I have already done my research, and continue daily in fact, I know much more than the average person regarding vaccines altogether, especially for this virus. There is no way that I will ever take the vax on my own volition. There are too many red flags and the coercion factors are extreme.",0.0
"I looked at the side effects and the vaccine type and make my decision. Also, I'm young and healthy and at no risk of dying from covid.",0.125
I wanted to look at the ratings and see what was most beneficial to what the side effects were.,0.0
Don't need it,0.125
I looked primarily at the effectiveness of each vaccine and took note if there were any serious side effects.,0.75
Personal experience talking,0.125
Biased against the vaccine,0.75
I have had a lot of people whos gotten the vaccine have really bad side effects and were hospitalized for months... some died and some never been the same again after the vaccine,0.25
My initial choice was to wait and not rush for the first vaccines choices. I have a medical background was skeptical about how effective the vaccines would be and I thought that they would not behave the way that the media and government was pushing. I took a wait and see approach. If the vaccines could fully prevent infection and in fact rid the world of COVID I would be a strong proponent but that isn't going to happen and honestly wasnt going to happen in the first place. I see the COVID vaccine the same as I see the Flu shot. I also do not take a yearly flu shot. I am not interested in taking a yearly (or even more frequent) COVID Vax.,0.0
