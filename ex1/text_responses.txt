Now I was neutral about the vaccines especially the news that Pfizer was hiding some data and Big pharma been making record profits from the vaccines. I think we should be casting doubt on the vaccines efficacy; it's good to get vaccinated but also respect other people's feelings about vaccine and whether they want to get jab or not it's completely up to them. The way that vaccine mandates have completely backfired and it's why I switched my attitude toward it."	"Neutral"

71	"I was looking for highest efficacy rates, really, and not too focused on side effects. I'd recently been vaccinated against shingles, penumonia, and had a T-dap vax. I had MMR as a kid (and a teen and a young adult, something about a bad batch of vax when I was young). I even have a smallpox vaccination scar. I remember a kid in elementary school who had trouble walking because she'd had polio. Most people under 50 today have no idea what a pandemic really looks like and also, rely too heavily on mass media\/tv and have poor critical thinking skills, so I worry for future generations, especially because of the anti-vax movement."	"Pro"
72	"Overall, I looked at how likely the severe risks were to occur and then looked at the overall effectiveness of the vaccine. If there were some rather high risk effects of the vaccine, it needed to be extremely effective at preventing COVID in order for me to consider taking it."	"Pro"
73	"I was worried about severe side effects since I don't want that. Also, if it's from China I don't trust it."	"Pro"

79	"My search was characterized by the variety and severity of the bad reactions created by the vaccines. My health is already greatly affected by fatigue, muscle soreness, etc. There is absolutely NO desire on my part to exacerbate those conditions with something that would not only make my life appreciably worse, but would do so at the expense of my ability to work."	"Anti"

83	"I looked at each item and weighed the pros and cons"	"Neutral"
84	"I focused more on the effectiveness rate than the side effects unless the rate of side effects were high and very severe."	"Pro"
85	"The benefits (protection) is more important to me than side effects - but some side effects are bad enough that they swayed my opinion. I have an autoimmune disorder so side effects of attacking the system is a hard no for me."	"Pro"
86	"I mostly looked at the risks and side-effects, since the vaccines don't really seem to prevent people from getting COVID."	"Anti"
87	"I looked at all the information provided and went with my gut in terms of what risk I was willing to take - or not."	"Neutral"
88	"I chose after seeing the side effects and the highest possible outcome. If the side effects were severe, but the percentage rate for effectiveness was high, I chose not to take the shot. If the side effects were minimal and the percentage of the effectiveness was high, I chose the shot."	"Neutral"

The FDA lost a court case and have been forced to release thousands of pages of information each month now.  Why not check out the TRUTH.  Many people are waking up to the cold hard facts.  There are MANY doctors risking their lives to get the TRUTH out.  Why have so many been killed?  The truth WILL Come out for ALL to see."	"Anti"
96	"If they had severe side effects I just wouldn't want to do it."	"Neutral"

98	"I wanted to read all of it and I just started in the left column and went down then repeated for the right. Because I am most afraid of getting long covid (much more so than dying, especially because vaccines are so effective against death), the most important piece of information to me was the level of protection against getting any covid infection since that can happen from even an asymptomatic case. However I was not willing to pay for these on principle because all covid vaccination should be free as it is a major PUBLIC health risk and not an individual burden, no matter what any one says."

I think there are a lot of things we just don't know yet aboutlong term events. Also, as I feel COVID-19 was developed in a lab in Wuhan, China, I do not want any vaccine from China. NO NO NO.  I will stick (no pun intended) with the tried and true methods of vaccination, even if they are not quite as effective. My daughter had the Pfizer vaccine, my husband had Moderna AND the booster, my son and I had J & J, my daughter and her husband both had the Pfizer plus booster and guess what?  We ALL---every single one of us--got the virus and we were all sick with about the same symptoms for the same amount of time. People in their mid twenties and people in their early sixties.  I think it has been a huge windfall for the pharmceutical companies and we were all dupes and guinea pigs. You know who has NOT ever gotten COVID-19? My brother, who never had one single vaccine.  This whole thing makes me distrust health \experts\ and makes me very skeptical of any new advice they have for us."	"Neutral"

I was born at night, but not last night."	"Anti"
104	"I tired to focus on the side effect numbers and gauged that against the benefits."	"Pro"
105	"I took a look at all of the benefits and risks and if the number of people experiencing side effects labeled as \severe\ were high, that made me less likely to take that vaccine.  I want to avoid severe headaches and muscle pain as much as possible, even if it means accepting a risk of blood clot or some other catastrophic event.  The rates of those catastrophic events were usually incredibly low, most times less than a fraction of 1%, so I was willing to risk that assuming that I would not have a horrible reaction like that."

I also have been taking the advice of my acupuncturist who is the only medical practitioner that I now trust. I  know a lot about this and I would never under any circumstances get  any of these poisonous vaccines. I personally know one woman who got heart inflammation from it and almost died and I know of another man who DID die from it . Not including all the other thousands of people all over the world who have died or been crippled by them . If I was held down by a government agent and forcibly injected with it I think I would be so terrified that I might commit suicide.  I would  be in such a state of terror that I would just lay in bed and shake and scream . I  am NOT anti vaccine . I got all the childhood ones and I got the shingles vaccine several years ago. THIS is different . It's just as much of a bioweapon as the virus that was deliberately unleashed on the world as an act of war by the communist Chinese government . And it worked . Western civilization , and especially America has been destroyed by it and now the Chi Coms are taking over the world . It's a nightmare ."	"Anti"

My confidence in vaccine manufacturers and medical bureaucrats in general has fallen massively during Covid19 response. India got a possible yes because they didn't play politics with their citizens health when Ivermectin was proven effective against severe Covid19, and simply distributed it in care packages."	"Anti"

I'm curious about some of the reported numbers, referring to the chances out of 1000000 that these negative effects occur, and wonder if they're a bit lower than what actually is the case in reality. I wasn't so concerned about prevention of infection with COVID, since that's almost impossible to truly avoid. Severe infection or death from COVID are things I'm statistically unlikely to experience, so those weren't major concerns either."	"Anti"

I actually have very little against CHOOSING to get vaccinated when I determine that the risk\/rewards are worth it. Unfortunately covid was 100% politicized and a major authoritarian power grab that has practically eliminated personal liberty in the US. We might \pretend\ that these measures are being eased up (why should I be thankful that the government is kind enough to give me back my freedom??) but the population has proven that they can be controlled with fear and will submit to anything that their overlords say.\n\nBut anyway, wouldn't touch anything from China, I have no faith in any numbers they may claim. I am skeptical of mRNA not because I distrust it, but because the government, pharmaceuticals, and media actively suppressed and ostracized anyone who hinted at having an alternate opinion, and refused to even consider that there might be cheaper \/ existing TREATMENTS rather than this blind desire for a vaccine."

I watched a video today about a pilot who had the shot (it is not a vaccine) and had a heart attack while flying a plane full of people. According to VAERS a lot of people are having very bad reactions. I used to get vaccines for my job because I worked in social services at schools, hospitals, and prisons. I will never get another vaccine again. Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab have an agenda."	"Anti"

161	"Well unfortunately given all that's happened around vaccines I came into the study having seen a lot of information (whether correct or not) and formed opinions on the vaccines. I understand statistical events but even when they are really low I still have to ask myself do I want to roll those dice? I was originally offered J&J as a first vaccine. I declined it because it had whole DNA in it and I didn't like the viral vector because even though it's said to be safe if you had been exposed to it, the the shot would be useless because your immune system would attack the vector before the DNA could be delivered to the cell. This is why I don't like vector vaccines. I've come to be very hesitant and skeptical about the mRNA vaccines as well. I don't know it that is still sitting in my body replicating to allow some side effect to come up later. Not to mention it's obvious at this point that they don't have anywhere near 90+% efficacy against infection. Anyway, regardless of the rate of incidence, if the side effect is severe I think twice about getting it because it seems like I always have all the side effects. Generally I would feel safer with taking a more traditional vaccine that contains subunits or disabled\/killed virus. And finally I feel that other mitigations are more important that vaccines currently available since they aren't doing a lot of good. In 2021 I was very much for these vaccines and I got the Pfizer vaccine as soon as it was available to me and I got the 2nd dose and even a booster, but now I'm not happy with the results of everyone still getting infected. So many people I know have been vaccinated and infected anyway and these vaccines do not protect anyone from long covid or whatever else this virus might do if it lingers around in the body like the epstein bar virus does. I hope you get what you need on this study but I think most people are going to come into it with bias from information outside the study unless they've been living in a remote cave or something"	"Anti"

That would mean 7,500 people in the US might get heart inflammation if all were vaccinated. I don't want to be one of the 7,500 people. I don't feel comfortable trusting the efficacy data without knowing the actual numbers used for the calculation."	"Anti"

I am double vaccinated and boosted with the Moderna shot, but after the British Medical Journal published about Pfizer potentially committing fraud -- and knowing that pharmaceutical companies are profit-driven even at the expense of the health and safety of patients -- I am beginning to have hesitancy around the Covid vaccines because they didn't go through the normal testing process to ensure safety.

I would be much more positive towards a European country developing a vaccine, or Chinese. In my search behavior, I always try and look for specialized working groups, because they always have the best information. UK's MHRA is very good, for example. When I watched the FDA's recent public hearing for VRBPAC, I was just horrified really. These vaccines aren't the same as previous vaccines, they're not being followed up if there was a problem. We don't have the provider support to understand that there could be a problem. And if they do, one wouldn't normally be able to find any neurological or rheumatological or hematological help here in the US. It's just very taxing to the system, as is COVID, to endeavor without being open to these possibilities. I look in the news too, because I may want to find some of the vaccines that aren't being supported the same as the main ones. I may want to look up more on say, non-natural nucleosides. I don't have a good knowledge about the mechanisms where I could fully explain it, but I do know that there is concern of backtracking into the body's DNA or mutagenesis. Not just people talking, people who give presentations. I do trust those scientists, because there is no other reason to bring it up unless it was a possible problem. In the news as well, it seems that fully vaccinated folks are testing positive. I don't know if they're diseased or not by the infection, but why even go there if I'm phobic of needles and pretty certain about the presence of immunological effects that I might not be able to recover from? So my general characterization in searching is about trust, I must find the trustable sources of information."	"Anti"

I chose to get all three of the Pfizer shots because of its effectiveness at that time.\nQuick backstory. Both of my daughters -in law are nurses. They refused to get vaccinated until they were ordered to by their hospitals in order to keep their jobs. Their husbands and children have not been vaccinated. Nor have my two brothers who are both in their 70's. They are both very active in their churches and they have worn their masks at every church function.

Funny how nobody is talking about how many people die of the flu every year. In the 2 months before the Ukraine war ended the \pandemic\ 100% of the patients that we had in FOR COVID were FULLY \VACCINATED\. Let that sink in. YOU KNOW this shot will not prevent the contraction of or the transmission of covi.  \THE UNVAX ARE GETTING THE VAX SICK.\  Think about that for a moment.  YOU KNOW that this doesn't add up. Have you never questioned any of this?  WE HAVE SEEN HOW THE NUMBERS WERE INFLATED. Do you know what a \case\ of covid is? It only requires a \positive\ PCR result?  Do you know anything about the \accuracy\of the flawed PCR tests? Look into it, it is well documented. THE WHO told the CDC and FDA to instruct labs to run the PCR tests at 45 cycles, not the 25 cycles that they are designed to be run at.  This is fact look it up.  Spoiler alert: accuracy goes right out the window above 25 cycles. ( Yes, I hang out with Lab tech too).  I could go on and on. Did you every wonder why the FDA refused to release the adverse effect and safety data? Freedom of information act and the courts FORCED them to release the data. They agreed to, OVER 75 YEARS!!!!! (Well documented fact) Why do you think that is?  They gathered this data in months.  The courts FORCED them to speed it up and it should be out by August of this year. I have a ton of information.

366	"I don't like side effects after vaccines. I know that a few days of side effects is better than the illness (and possibly death) but if I can prevent side effects while also getting protected, that is the choice I make. That is how I decided. A balance between manageable side effects and good efficiency in the vaccine."	"Pro"

I have auto immune and under no circumstances will I be convinced to take a vaccine that can cause additional harm or inflammation to my nerves, muscles or heart.  The effectiveness of the vaccine is sad. Have you ever heard of anyone getting a \little bit\ of the measles?"	"Anti"
406	"I mainly just compared the severity of side of effects (not really caring about the chance of the side effects. I'm not taking the chance on facial paralysis, no matter how small it is. Any kind of paralysis is one of my major fears. ) with the effectiveness against COVID. If the COVID effectiveness was anything below 90%, it was a no from me."	"Pro"

408	"I have had very severe reactions to vaccines in the past. I would often get chronically ill when taking them. When I stopped participating in Western medicine my health improved dramatically. I had my last vaccine over 20 years ago. \n\nI have never tested positive for Covid 19, however I did test positive for antibodies. I've been in situations where I've been exposed multiple times and have not tested positive. \n\nI work in the arts where people are VERY gung ho about the vaccine and love to shame people who haven't had it. Many of these twice Jabbed and boosted people have had Covid. \n\nI have completely changed my lifestyle because of Covid. I only hang out with a very small group of people. I'm rarely around more than 5-10 people ate any given time. I work alone and independently. I don't go to parties and if I got to a bar or restaurant it's only during very off hours. \n\nI take Covid seriously. I get tested regularly and isolate if I feel so much as a cold. \n\nI would be willing to get a vaccine in the future potentially if vaccinated people didn't get Covid! Right now I don't have faith in the pharmaceutical companies, the CDC or the government. \n\nI will not under any circumstances pay to not be vaccinated!"	"Neutral"
409	"I first looked to how effective the vaccine was even against just a regular COVID-19 infection because I have underlying health conditions that might put me at risk just for getting infected. Seeing that information first was what helped me decide whether it was worth the side effects or not. I wasn't scared off of any vaccine because of scary side effects because most of the worst ones had such a low frequency. Mostly, I just didn't think any side effects were worth a vaccine with less than a 75% effective rate against a regular Covid infection."	"Pro"

411	"I'm not what you mean by \how you searched for information\ but I wanted to chose the vaccines that gave me the most coverage and the least risk so that the symptoms would be worth it. I would be willing to have a fever if it prevented death and hospitalization by 90% for example but not risk paralysis for a 70% effectiveness."	"Pro"

For those vaccines with what I considered more dire risks (for example having the immune system attack parts of the body), that formed the bulk of my decision--I would *not* select that vaccine.\n\nFor the ones that didn't have such dire risks, I then concentrated more on the benefits, where I would rate vaccines with higher levels of preventing death or severe COVID-19 infections as being more desirable."	"Pro"
421	"I always looked at all the information, but I was particularly interested in the protection against severe COVID-19 and death. Typically I'm not too worried about the side effects since the really bad ones are very unlikely to happen, and the other side effects are less dangerous than getting severe COVID-19."	"Pro"
422	"I worry about death and significant side effects, so that is number one.  I factor in a little that they may be underestimating as the studies were rushed and probably flawed.  On the effectiveness side I don't want to get injected with things unless it is likely to do the job.  So pretty much above 90 effectiveness or no.  I am not worried about myself - I am healthy, not immunocompromised, etc.  But I am willing to do my part to help society and others.  Ultimately there is some risk we can die of anything."	"Pro"

438	"I looked for the least severe and scary reactions and the best outcomes for severe covid19 possiblities.  Getting covid19 had less of a factor because I see covid19 as something that we all my catch eventually and that doesn't scare me because I am vaccinated and double boosted."	"Pro"
439	"I looked at the number of people who suffered side-effects vs how effective the vaccine was in protecting people from infection, severe infection, and especially, death.

I take COVID-19 very seriously and feel grateful for the vaccines."	"Pro"

I think that a lot of the vaccines that I've received in my lifetime probably have similar risk possibilities as the ones listed in this study, so I tried to not be too critical of any of them, but any vaccines with side effects that seemed to affect larger portions of people had to be well effective against COVID-19 for me to be in support of it."

I am also young and very healthy, and I know that side effects are just a sliver of what can come with full-blown COVID. I also experienced side effects from all three doses of the vaccine I received, and if anything, I was happy to know that the vaccine was doing its job. Furthermore, when I got COVID myself, I was already double vaccinated, and the symptoms were still pretty bad for me \u2014 I had the sorest throat I had ever had in my life and I lost my voice almost entirely for several days.

560	"I did not search at all. I had a bad case of covid and received the monoclonal antibodies. I am already on blood thinners so the risk of that side effect is small. I learned all about the vaccines both from my doctor, and my son who is an infectious disease MD"	"Pro"
561	"mostly relied on the percentages and the severity of the side effects."	"Pro"
562	"In general, I didn't pay much attention to the risks and mostly focused on how effective each vaccine was at preventing COVID-19 infection and death. Many of the risks were very uncommon side effects. The only one I remember standing out was the 1-in-10 risk for severe muscle pain, which is NOT the worst side effect possible."	"Pro"
563	"I had an allergic reaction to the first does of moderna covid vaccine.

566	"I took the information presented to be true as instructed.  I looked at the odds and found all of them better than no vaccination."	"Pro"
567	"The utmost important consideration for me was the overall efficacy of preventing an infection, mitigating the effects of COVID-19, and how successful the vaccine was in preventing death. Other than that, I looked at the ratio of more severe side effects (like facial paralysis) and decided if the percentage was low enough for me to consider using the specific vaccine. The form of vaccine, like mRNA or viral vector, did not matter as much to me."	"Pro"

578	"I think all the vaccines had a decently high number for protecting against death from Covid, and very low numbers for any serious risks. Therefore I think taking the vaccine outweighs the risks in all of the cases. Especially because I live with a loved one that is compromised, so the vaccine would also help protect them as well."	"Pro"
579	"The higher percent of effectiveness, with the fewest side effects, or life endangering side effects.  I had no side effects with Phisers' vaccine, so I knew that would be my first choice."	"Pro"
580	"I went by the percentage it protects from covid-19, severe covid-19 and death-covid-19.  Next, I went by the number of how many people experience side effects and what the side effects are.  From there I decided if the data was really good to warrant taking the specific vaccine."	"Pro"
581	"No"	"Pro"
582	"I wanted to know most importantly the three factors, effectiveness of reducing death, severe illness, and contracting the illness.  I knew that the severe side effects were quite rare, so I checked these but was less concerned. I was not particularly concerned about minor side effects. I concentrated on effectiveness. I was most interested in preventing severe illness and death, and most interested in mRNA vaccines, which I had researched when the vaccines first came out. So, I checked these thoroughly."	"Pro"

587	"I have a bias against medical technology that originates in China so China was knocked out consistently.  Next, how effective was the vaccine in  preventing death, then severe infection and lastly infection at all.  Lastly I measured severe side effects vs uncomfortable side effects.  Severe being judged upon the numbers as more important."	"Pro"
588	"I had to look at all the information presented me.\nIn order to weigh\u2014you know\u2014the pros against the cons.\nAs you saw, there were some vaccines I specifically denounced.\nI denounced some of these: and I feel sorry for those individuals who were stuck with such inferior options.\n\nWhat did you mean by \severe muscle pain \ by the way?\nIs that the feeling one normally gets, eventually, by way of one's immune system kicking up its inflammatory response to the foreign invaders?\n(The \terr'ists \ as George W. would say\u00bf)\nOr is this a severity above and beyond the normal \flu-like\ experience?"	"Pro"
589	"I looked at every single box for every single vaccine to have the most information possible."	"Pro"
590	"I made sure to look at all the pro's and con's even if I decided against on each. Anything with 95% efficacy or less was an immediate dismissal. Unfortunately the sever side-effects of the more effective vaccines, while unlikely, where very off-putting. As far as I'm aware, past vaccines weren't really allowed to be made publicly available if a good number of people were having moderate reactions ... much less severe to life threatening ones.\n\n((I don't know if I'll get to mention the part where I was asked to pay to AVOID being vaccinated, but I put $0 on that not because I was on the fence but I felt that was some weirdly dystopian measure that I'd not put money into out of principle.))"	"Neutral"

593	"Most research centered around possible side effects and their severity."	"Neutral"
594	"When evaluating each vaccine, I mainly considered how high the percentage was for protection from severe COVID infection and death as well as the degree of the risk of severe complications that could be long-term. I most strongly favor vaccines that have a very high percentage of protection against severe infection and death from COVID and also have a relatively low risk of severe complications that I assume could be long-term."	"Pro"
595	"I feel like there needs to be more data available in order for me to take any Covid 19 vaccines."	"Anti"
596	"I feel that I searched with equal amounts of fear of negative effects, and enthusiasm for good results. I tried not to let country of origin be a primary factor, but there are some countries I'd avoid, either because they are hostile to us, or I don't know enough about their technology to trust it. For example, Russia was not on the list, but it had been, that would have been an automatic \no\ based on both of those reasons. I avoided vaccines if it seemed if I felt there was an unreasonable risk of a dangerous side effect, such as blood clots or heart inflammation, but I have no problem with the normal immune response side effects I'm used to - tiredness, muscle pain, fever, etc. I was excited about some of the positive stats. They triggered thoughts of the \normal\ things I could do if vaccinated with that choice."	"Pro"

602	"I looked at all the information available."	"Pro"
603	"I have been reading peer reviewed clinical trial journals like the Lancet for the past two years and am not a vaccine advocate."	"Anti"
604	"I was more concerned with the possible side effects than the possible benefits. I first wanted to know what possible side effects there were, then how likely each side effect was before I even went over the benefits columns. Then if the benefits weren't all that great either, I didn't want anything to do with the vaccine. To me the possible side effects themselves were also more important than the probability of those side effects happening. Just the fact that it happens enough that it is considered a side effect at all is enough for me to be too afraid to get the vaccine."	"Anti"
605	"This is what I have learned about how sneakie and underhanded the media has been. Instead of letting the facts speak for themselves and letting people make their own choices devoid of media bias, the media made it very hard to trust any info out there by removing anything and everything they do not agree with and putting in their pie in the sky ideas and people saw this and it really ruined many peoples trust in the media and government agencies and good luck getting that back."	"Neutral"
606	"I simply hovered my mouse over the risks and side effects first, which often resulted in me ruling out vaccines if they had high incidence of severe side effects. However, I waited to hover over the protections and effectiveness info also before making my final decision of whether to get the vaccine or not. I was searching for vaccines that had high levels of effectiveness in preventing infection, serious symptomatic infection, and death, especially, from COVID-19."	"Pro"
607	"I asked around which vaccination was better and so I went with Moderna as it seem to have fewer after-effects."	"Anti"
608	"Well, in the beginning I knew I would never agree to get a vaccine, but I did look at the info.  I would never get one from China.  I looked at side effects and no matter how small the percentage I didn't want to be one of them who suffered.  This vaccine is a political stunt.  I've known fully vaccinated people in perfect health getting covid and put on a vent and dying.  I'll take my chances.  I use supplements to pump up my immune system.  The government should focus on diabetes and things like that!!!!!"	"Anti"
609	"I simply hovered over each option, read the information and made my choice."	"Anti"

612	"Other than the potential risks and benefits presented to me, I found myself trying to remember the information regarding covid-19 vaccines I heard or read in the news. I think the country origin of the vaccine is very important to determine the trustworthiness of the vaccine itself. I first looked at the country, and then the risks, and lastly the benefits of the vaccine."	"Pro"

616	"I paid close attention to the country of origin, I would be more afraid to get a vaccine from China. I honestly do not feel comfortable getting the Covid vaccine yet as there is just not enough information regarding long-term and future side effects or complications. So it was difficult for me to feel positive about any of the vaccine choices."	"Anti"

620	"I did not have a specific reason in regards to the way that I searched for information in the choice task. To be honest, I wanted to gather all information that was provided for each vaccine. Even with the amount of data that was presented, I was not willing to take any vaccination."	"Anti"
621	"I don't want to get a vaccine mainly because cells used from aborted fetuses were used in the research and testing stages of most vaccine production. So, I tried to see if any info was provided on vaccines that didn't use aborted fetal cells in any stage but this wasn't provided. So, I just hit the no option for each vaccine. I wasn't sure if the viral vaccines or subunit vaccines were fetal cell free. I wish that info had been provided. There's got to be a vaccine out there that doesn't use aborted fetal cells in any stage. I also tried looking at the side effects closely. Even if there's a small risk, I'd rather be safe than sorry."	"Anti"
622	"Trust was a big factor for me. Not all developers are trustworthy in my opinion. I believe at least one (i.e., Pfizer) has ulterior motives for some of their actions and I don't feel a need to enrich the company at my own medical risk. In addition to that, I determined the seriousness of the side effects in comparison to the likelihood that it would actually affect me personally. If it's something I could live with, such as muscle pain, tiredness, etc., then I am more likely to take the risk and get the vaccine."	"Neutral"

And let's be for real, old people catch and die from common colds that turn into pneumonia all the time. Anything takes them out because they have weakened immune systems."	"Anti"

Just before the world shut down for Covid. I guess it must have been March 2020. There was no vaccine yet according to the News, but they were giving vaccines to everyone during that time. My Doctor promised me that I would not get the corona virus. My job shut down and I went traveling. I tested every few months, always negative. Finely it got me, Jan 28, 2022. I think I got it from a travel employee who checked my travel ticket. He had watery eyes, and I thought he looks like he has a fever. Then the next day, I tested positive, I was told for the omnicrom? I do not know the spelling. I was in isolation for ten days they said. Mostly  I felt tired, and mild regular flu symptoms. They tested me after 7 days. I was negative and free to go. I imagine that all of the vaccines are good but they are also bad. Mostly I am slightly afraid of the side effects. I did not get sick the entire time, then when I got sick it was mild. I still wear my mask on public bus. But most people where I am do not use their mask. I feel great. And I pray that the virus may be under control. That we as a world can move away from a pandemic that shut down our jobs and our world. Yet, I did enjoy aspects of covid. Like isolation, and staying home resting, I used the time to travel and I had a good time. I feel sorry for families that lost loved one's. I am lucky I did not lose anyone. I just want for the covid drama to be over. I do not want to contaminate my biological unit with any stuff. I mean tell me whatever about any vaccine, but I have always taken vaccines for everything, whenever instructed to. But covid vaccine creeps me out. I do not why."	"Anti"

728	"A vaccination for anything, Covid or whatever disease, should not have any adverse affects\/effects to a person, period. If it's the correct vaccination, there would be no side effects. It would kill off the disease\/germ\/bacteria before it caused a problem with anything, it would only attack what it needs to attack without causing symptoms or death. Scientist have people believing that side effects are the norm for vaccinations, well it's not. The statistical numbers are a bunch of bullshit too... I had friends to die in my community from taking the vaccines and boosters and had some contracted heart problems and weaknesses and were healthy people. The one's of us that have not been vaccinated have not died or had any worse side effects than having a cold or flu. I know for a fact that Covid is real, I seen people catch it and I have seen the aftermath. \nAnother reason that I will not take it, I had to take a flu shot because I was working at a nursing home, back 15 or so years ago and I contracted bronchitis and I had it really bad for two weeks and thought I was going to die. I had never been sick in my life with flu or anything and after I got over that, I have never had another flu shot and I will not get another vaccine for it. I rarely ever get sick and it's because I know how to use common sense by wearing a mask and keeping things clean and avoiding people."	"Anti"

908	"I looked at all the data presented in this study and looked at the numbers in great detail.  Most of the information now on vaccines is misinformation.   To give you an idea why, Pfizer work hard with the courts to hide all data on the trial studies and wanted to keep this information from the public for 75 years!  The courts struck down Pfizer's request and was ordered to release information on the trial studies, 500 pages at a time.  In this information, they listed 1,195 known side affects from their vaccine.  I know much more than the average person on vaccines and I have read many studies from the US and internationally on Covid-19.  Here is what I found out with my investigation.   The Covid-19 vaccine is not a vaccine from Pfizer but an experimental gene therapy.  Animals who where first given the covid-19 vaccine in the beginning trials all died.  This vaccine is not approved and has not been  tested on humans before vaccination began.  We also do not know the long term effects of this gene therapy because it takes 8-10 years to complete long term studies.  The Covid-19 is a real virus and it can kill some older people as well as people who have a compromised Immune systems.  Covid-19 has been around since the 1970's, but not in this form.  Covid-19 has been weaponized and was created in a lab in China.  What makes this virus unique is that it has a very high rate of gain of function with spiked proteins, meaning it can spread very easily and very fast.  The person who discovered Aids has published several papers on Covid-19.  He is a top scientist and virologists.  After looking at the virus under a microscope, he found it to be a virus with five different strains in it.  It also has as an HIV delivery system.  There can be no vaccine made to counter this.  This Covid-19 virus is in the Influenza, cold, flu, and pneumonia family.  This virus mutates quickly.  It is impossible to find a vaccine that will work with Covid-19 because it changes so fast.  And like the common cold, it is impossible to find a working vaccine for this strain, because there are thousands of strains."	"Anti"

1109	"I have a few health complications that put me in direct jeopardy of heart and blood clotting issues with any of the vaccines. My doctor has currently advised me that the risk they pose to someone with my history isn't worth it.  Until something better comes along or more testing has been done I rely heavily on masking and good overall health practices and quarantining.  if it changes then I am open to trying something safer for myself.  Also if I had to pay to not receive a voluntary vaccine or for a government to force certain health care options on me then it's time for a new government.  That is insanely unethical. coronavirus is just that it's a virus it's not polio.  The flu is also a virus and the flu shot is voluntary.  Society doesn't have any right to force people to make health decisions that is an individual choice.  If a person is dumb enough to make the wrong choice well that's their right to."	"Neutral"

Originally touted as 100% effective...now being told a booster shot will be needed on a regular bases..only increases ones chances to encounter adverse side affects.  No, thank you.

I have a medical background was skeptical about how effective the vaccines would be and I thought that they would not behave the way that the media and government was pushing.

If the vaccines could fully prevent infection and in fact rid the world of COVID I would be a strong proponent but that isn't going to happen and honestly wasnt going to happen in the first place. I see the COVID vaccine the same as I see the Flu shot. I also do not take a yearly flu shot. I am not interested in taking a yearly (or even more frequent) COVID Vax."	"Anti"
